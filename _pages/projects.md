During my journey to my doctorate, I have been involved in various research projects. Here you can find more details on past and ongoing projects.

## Generating synthesised mobility traces


## Interpretable and Robust ML
The past few years have seen rapid development in transportation applications using DL. However, such networks are often challenging to interpret and lack robustness. Through the collaboration with the [Swiss Data Science Center (SDSC)](https://datascience.ch/), we aim to bring together the knowledge of GIS and DL, advancing our understanding of how interpretable and robust machine learning methods can be tailored to mobility analysis with the support of causal inference. The outcome of this research will help develop more interpretable and reliable DL models for tackling transport-related issues. 


## Next location prediction

## Long-term mobility behaviour

## Trackintel

Our work at the MIE lab is centred around processing and analysing individual tracking data. With many projects that share similar preprocessing pipelines, we had the idea of collecting the commonly used preprocessing and analysing functions into an open-source Python library. This is the beginning of trackintel, a structured and well-maintained framework for individual tracking data analysis. The core of trackintel is the hierarchical data model for movement data used in GIS, transport planning and related fields, which supports tracking data from various sources (e.g., GNSS tracking data, call detailed records, location-based social networks). 

This is a joined work with my colleagues [Dominik Bucher](http://dominikbucher.com/), [Henry Martin](https://n.ethz.ch/~martinhe/) and Nina Wiedemann. Check out the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2023.101938) and the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mie-lab/trackintel)!
