During my journey to my doctorate, I have been involved in various research projects. Here you can find more details on past and ongoing projects.

## Generating synthesised mobility traces

## Interpretable and Robust ML

## Next location prediction

## Long-term mobility behaviour

## Trackintel

Our work at the MIE lab is centred around processing and analysing individual tracking data. With many projects that share similar preprocessing pipelines, we had the idea of collecting the commonly used preprocessing and analysing functions into an open-source Python library. This is the beginning of trackintel, a structured and well-maintained framework for individual tracking data analysis. The core of trackintel is the hierarchical data model for movement data used in GIS, transport planning and related fields, which supports tracking data from various sources (e.g., GNSS tracking data, call detailed records, location-based social networks). This is a joined work with my colleagues [Dominik Bucher](http://dominikbucher.com/), [Henry Martin](https://n.ethz.ch/~martinhe/) and Nina Wiedemann.
