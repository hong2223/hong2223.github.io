Welcome!
======

I am Ye Hong, currently pursuing a doctoral degree at ETH Zurich, supervised by [Martin Raubal](https://www.raubal.ethz.ch/) and [Konrad Schindler](https://igp.ethz.ch/personen/person-detail.html?persid=143986). I work in the [Mobility Information Engineering (MIE) Lab](http://mie-lab.ethz.ch/) at the [Chair of Geoinformation Engineering](https://gis.ethz.ch/en/), ETH Zurich. Before starting the doctoral journey, I obtained my master's degree in Geomatic from ETH Zurich and a bachelor's degree in GIS and RS from Sun Yat-sen University, China.
