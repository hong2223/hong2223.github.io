* Our paper [Trackintel: An open-source Python library for human mobility analysis](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2023.101938) was published in *Computers, Environment and Urban Systems*. Check out the Python trackintel library for human mobility analysis on [GitHub](https://github.com/mie-lab/trackintel)!
* Our study [Conserved quantities in human mobility](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trc.2022.103979) was published in *Transportation Research Part C*. We showed that individuals implicitly balance new behaviour exploration and existing option exploitation over time, resulting in a conserved number of basic travel mode and activity location combinations. 
* We presented our study [How do you go where? improving next location prediction by learning travel mode information using transformers](https://doi.org/10.1145/3557915.3560996) at SIGSPATIAL '22 in Seattle, USA. Our proposed transformer decoder-based model utilizing location, travel mode and time-related information for next location prediction achieved state-of-the-art performance on large scale tracking datasets.
